## 📖 About

Ledgerly is a store management system designed to help small businesses track their sales and payments. Originally created for my mother's store, it has been open-sourced as a portfolio project. Because of the nature of the project, the values, numbers and names are brazilian, so it's not a good example for international use.

## 📝 Demo
